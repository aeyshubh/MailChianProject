I have literally created this project in 4 hours so sorry for the frontend.
<h2>A 5 yo can also use this</h2>

Explanation:
<h2>Let's say you have x addresses of your frens and want to setup a meet with them,you don't have their discord or anything ,how would you do that ??</h2>
<h2>Ans: Just paste their wallet address in my app's textbox and they will be notified with a Huddle01 Meeting link which they can further join and you folks can have a good conversation there</h2>
<h2>A Huddle01 meeting link is generated on runtime which is shared with the receipent address on MailChain,with just a click</h2>
<h2>No Gas,No signatures,beautiful UX</h2>
